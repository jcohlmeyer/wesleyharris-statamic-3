  In this inlay pendant, the pieces of shell and wood are carefully selected and shaped so as to imply a sunset.

  The abalone includes lovely pink areas, and shapes within the iridescence look like the sun and its reflection. The wood is cut to look like silhouetted hills and, together with the shell, become something more than the sum of the parts.

  The inlay itself is mechanically secured by the surrounding metal. No glue is used.

    description: 'All the excess metal above the picture plane is filed off flush to the inlay. Great care is taken to avoid forcing burred edges of metal down into the inlay. Any burring that does threaten to press into the inlay is carefully removed with engraving tools.'
