  Tanzanite is a brittle gemstone. In this sculptural ring the tanzanite is well protected from harsh wear.

  The design is an exercise in continuous line â€” a single length of gold swings up around and under itself where it embraces the stone.

  The tanzanite has been prong set from the back. This allows the visible surface around the stone to be pre-polished, to be made with a feeling of thickness and substance, and to remain untouched during the actual setting.

    Within the back of the ring, four "troughs" are carved into the walls of the stone setting area. These will receive the four prongs. The prongs are constructed as a unit (shown in the tweezers). The tips of the four prongs are precisely soldered onto the "bottom" of each trough.'
