  In 2003, I received a Canada Council for the Arts grant to research and create mokume gane on a hollowware scale. Mokume gane is Japanese for "woodgrain metal." It is a lamination technique that begins with a stack of multiple layers of metal of contrasting colours. This stack is fused under heat and pressure into a solid block, then forged out to a workable sheet. During the forging process, some of the internal layers are exposed by being carved, drilled, filed and/or engraved into, then hammered flat, then carved again, then hammered flat, etc.

  In the Rose Bowl, the bowl portion itself was completed during the grant period, but one area of its surface was flawed and tended to de-laminate and crack a little. In 2010, I added a handle to the Rose Bowl in such a way as to cover this flawed area.

  The gemstone in the handle is a beautiful Sphalerite (facetted by Edgar Hasselfeldt). Sphalerite has a higher refractive index than diamond. The brilliant reds and yellows of this stone perfectly echo the rich 22 k. yellow gold and copper colours in the mokume gane.

    description: 'The fused stack. The layers were bolted between steel plates under hydraulic pressure. The assembly of bolted steel and mokume stack was embedded in charcoal inside a sealed stainless steel foil bag (to create a reducing or non-oxidizing atmosphere). The stainless steel bag and its contents were heated in a digital kiln for 14 hours at a temperature just below the melting point of any eutectic alloy between the layers (about 1400 degrees fahrenheit). Under these conditions, molecular growth between the layers fuses the stack into a solid block.'

    description: 'The sphalerite is set, and the area below the stone is contoured to a handle shape that will comfortably receive one''s fingers. The area on the bowl that had been problematic due to de-lamination and cracking is now prepared to be overlapped by the handle. Holes for rivets are drilled in alignment through both the bowl and the handle.'
