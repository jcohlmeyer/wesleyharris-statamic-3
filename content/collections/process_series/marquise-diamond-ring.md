  The Marquise Diamond Ring was an interesting commission.  
  The customer supplied me with many images including several derived from nature. All had a common feeling of entanglement or of something entwined. The image that inspired me the most was of a tree branch tightly wrapped with heavy roots or vines.  
  For greatest visual clarity, we decided to wrap yellow gold around a central wire of white gold. This contrast also pleased me from the standpoint that the wires had to be assembled â€” as nature would have done. The ring could never have been cast or poured in a mold.
  The following process series clearly illustrates how this ring was built.
