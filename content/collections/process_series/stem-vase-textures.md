  The Stem Vase with Textures was created in response to an invitational show called "Three Elements" at Zilberschmuck gallery in Toronto, Canada. The theme was interesting. Three numbers generated from my date of birth were used determine three elements on the Periodic Table. We were then asked to interpret various properties of our three elements in the creation of a piece.

  My first element was #55 Caesium. It is a soft silvery-gold metal that becomes liquid at room temperature, so I took this as my cue to create melted textures in silver and gold.

  My second element was #23 Vanadium. It is a silvery-gray metal that is very malleable and ductile. Vanadium dependent enzymes are found in marine algae and Vanadium binding proteins are found in such underwater organisms as Seasquirts and Tunicates. As I created the "garden" or landscape within the base of the Stem Vase, I found myself increasingly thinking of it as an underwater scene.

  My third element was #58 Cerium. Cerium oxide is used to make the polishing compound called jeweller's rouge. I took this as my cue to give all the smooth surfaces of the Stem Vase a bright, mirror-like finish.

  The largest green gemstone is a rare colour of Sphalerite. It was skillfully facetted by Edgar Hasselfeldt. Sphalerite has a refractive index higher than diamond, a distinct six-way cleavage, is very soft and brittle, but extremely beautiful.

    description: 'On the right is the beginning of the base. A sterling sheet has been formed into a cylinder, joined, then trimmed to the open shape seen here. Smithing of this shape has just begun. On the left are five chunks of pure silver that have been partly melted.'

    description: After several courses of smithing, the desired shape for the base has been achieved. Throughout the process, circular plastic template (not shown) was tightly fit into the base to keep it perfectly round.

    description: The surface inside the base has been smoothed and is ready for the "underwater seascape" of melted pure silver chunks to be fit and soldered in place. The pure silver has been carved to receive onyx beads. The stem of the amber blossom (with its central sphene and 18 k. green gold leaves) fits into a length of tubing.

    description: Six chunks of partially melted pure silver were constructed into the base to create the "underwater garden". There are now places for 5 onyx beads, a sphalerite, a sphene, and the amber blossom.

    description: A texture of melted pure silver and 18k green gold is being constructed from multiple watercastings. This will be built to fit and fill the open area on the back of the vase.

    description: This photo shows both textures. The similarity in colour from the green gold to the green sphalerite and sphene pleases me.
