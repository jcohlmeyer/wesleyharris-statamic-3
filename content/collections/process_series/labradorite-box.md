  The commission for this box came from a man who was inspired by having seen an entire floor made of labradorite. I took this as my cue to create an architecturally inspired piece.
  On the top surface of the box, the pattern of labradorite resembles that of a floor tile. When the cross-shaped lid is removed, the remaining box looks like a fort or castle with four towers at the corners. The corner posts themselves are constructed in a pattern that looks like a flattened column or pilaster.

    description: 'This photo is taken part way through the process of constructing the sides of the box. Four rivet posts can be seen in the areas for the four side panels of labradorite. Less obviously visible, two rivet posts can also be seen at the top of each flattened column panel of sterling â€” these will be used to secure the four small corner post squares of labradorite on top.'

    description: 'The finished piece. All stones are secured by way of flared rivets. The four walls are also riveted together at the corners, and the four corner stones on top are riveted in place. All surfaces are polished, and the recessed areas of the sterling pattern are oxidized.'
