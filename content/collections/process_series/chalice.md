  The Chalice is a student piece. At the time, in 1980, the price of silver had soared to $50 an ounce. My high school art teacher, Mr. Arthur Brecken (who began me in silversmithing) sent me his 30 year's worth of silver scrap to reclaim, and then gave me one third of it to use. The Chalice was made from this metal.

  The beauty of working with metal directly from the ingot is that a substantial thickness can be retained in the finished piece. This gives both visual and physical weight â€” indeed, the Chalice weighs 16 ounces.

  In 1981 the Chalice won the annual Silver Design Competition, a student competition sponsored by the Silversmith's Guild of America, and this led directly to my being employed as a commercial silver designer.

    description: 'The process used to smith the Chalice bowl is called "sinking." It differs from "raising" in that the hammering is done on the inner surface of the bowl against a flat steel surface, and the shape of the hammer-head used is spherical. "Sinking" a bowl is the composite result of repeated courses of dimpling the surface.'
