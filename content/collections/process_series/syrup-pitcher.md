  The design of this pitcher is an exercise in simplicity. Set on edge, a single length of sterling sheet curves around to form the walls of the vessel and then scrolls tightly at each end to form two handles.

  Form and function flow effortlessly together. The handles receive either the user's right or left hand, and the pitcher can be poured in either direction.

  The interior shape is governed by the outline of a Nova Scotia agate that is set in the base. The agate itself almost implies a scene â€” like a lighthouse surrounded by storm clouds.

    description: 'The basic form of the pitcher is complete. The agate is cut and polished. A base is soldered into the pitcher with a "window" for the agate. A second frame, the same shape as the base, is also shown. This will fit the outer surface of the agate and eventually hold it in place.'

    description: 'The agate and second frame, precisely seated together, are shown in place. The outer edge of the frame is bevelled, and the bottom edge of the vessel itself serves as a bezel. The stone held by the frame will be set as a unit. Also, prior to this, the pitcher''s pouring spout shapes will be gently flared.'
