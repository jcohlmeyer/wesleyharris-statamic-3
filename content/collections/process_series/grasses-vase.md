  The Grasses Vase was my introductory raising project as a student at Cranbrook Academy of Art. The vase portion is smithed from a 12" disc of 16 guage (1.29 mm. thick) red brass, and the base is smithed from a smaller disc of the same material.

  In order to refine the bulb-shaped form of the vase and to planish it, I cut it into two parts at its widest point. When soldered back together, a line of sterling silver was added to visually articulate the join, and similar lines of sterling were added to the rim of the vase and to the edge of the base.

  The patina is a result of coating the piece with vinegar and exposing it for 12 hours to an atmosphere of ammonia fumes. The colouration that results affects the red brass but leaves the sterling silver lines in bright contrast.

    description: 'The finished metalwork. The bulb-shaped portion involved more than 50 courses of raising plus considerable swaging of the neck [please see the Chalice process for a description of swaging]. The 12" diameter of the original disc now measures 30". The bulb shape was then cut in half at its widest point, the form refined and planished, and the two halves soldered back together with a strip of sterling silver articulating the join. A sterling edge was also soldered to the rim of the vase. A base was smithed and a similar sterling edge soldered to it. The finished piece stands 16" high.'
