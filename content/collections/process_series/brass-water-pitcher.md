  With this water pitcher, I challenged myself by raising a vessel where its handle is attached as part of the original sheet. I love the seamless surface of the finished piece.

  In this process series, a set of diagrams illustrate and explain the mechanics of the metalsmithing process called "raising" that is used here.

  Part way through the shaping process, the interior of the pitcher was "tinned" by having silver solder flowed over the entire surface.

  The handle of the pitcher is level. Within the handle has been constructed a "landscape" of moss agate "pools," at first geometric as if in a formal garden, and then naturally shaped "pools" that flow down three levels via sterling "waterfalls." The implication is of fresh spring water flowing into a vessel whose very function is to hold and pour fresh water.

    description: 'Here the red arrows show the effect of raising. Literally, the diameter along the surface of the original disk increases as its circumference is reduced.'

    description: 'About 22 courses. While smithing the area under the handle, the angle of the metal to the steel stake is increased. The angle of raising under the spout area is slightly decreased. This results in an asymmetrical shape.'

    description: 'The finished piece showing how much more the front area is brought in and raised higher. The entire piece is planished smooth using nearly flat-faced hammers â€” the metal is literally "ironed" between conforming steel surfaces. The planished piece is now work-hardened and very strong. The entire surface is filed and polished to a mirror-like shine.'

    description: 'The finished handle with a "landscape" built up of layers of sterling sheet and set with 7 moss agates. The entire sterling unit is secured both by being riveted to the brass handle below and by being bezel-set along its edges.'
