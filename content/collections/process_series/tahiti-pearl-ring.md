  The design of this sculptural ring protects the pearl and is surprisingly comfortable to wear. It unfolds from a single heavy round wire.

  The result combines an appearance of simplicity with three-dimensional interest.

  The pearl is a beautiful natural specimen from Tahiti.

    description: 'Ring shank is joined, and the entire form is filed true. A post will be soldered into the ring onto which the pearl will be set. This post will be "barbed" with engraving tool stitch-marks. The pearl will be drilled as to fit tightly against these "barbs." The pearl will then be locked in place with epoxy.'
