  This sculptural ring is surprisingly comfortable to wear. Its X-shaped form is simple and visually strong, yet it holds a delicate pink stone that can be described as feminine.

  The stone, an asymmetrically cut rose quartz, is tension set. It literally hovers in its place above the area between the wearerâ€™s fingers, and light freely enters from above and below.

    description: 'The X shape is clamped in a vise. A steel dowel is positioned to force the X open enough to allow the stone to enter. Prior to this, the same part of the X shape was squeezed partly closed. This closing then opening of the shape results in just enough spring tension to lock the stone tightly in place.'
