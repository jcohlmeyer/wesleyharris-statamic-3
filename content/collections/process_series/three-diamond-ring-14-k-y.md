  This ring was made using three diamonds from an old engagement ring. Two diamonds are the same size and the third is larger.

  The design places all three stones in the ends of heavy gold wires that bypass one another at right angles. The resulting sculptural form is direct, and its three-dimensional interest invites investigation.
