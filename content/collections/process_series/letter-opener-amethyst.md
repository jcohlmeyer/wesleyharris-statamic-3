  This letter opener is smithed directly from a 20 ounce ingot of pure silver. It has been forged and left considerably work-hardened.
  The whiteness of pure silver is beautiful and should never tarnish.
  The form of this piece is pleasing in its simplicity. The letter opener stands stably on its own, and its shape easily receives the hand. Light illuminates the amethyst from above and below.
