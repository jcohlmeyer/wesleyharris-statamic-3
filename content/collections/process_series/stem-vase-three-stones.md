  This piece is unusual in my output because I created it with no pre-conceived design in mind. I had 35 triangular corner-cuttings of sterling sheet left over from earlier work and simply began to stack them in a sort of spiral staircase. During construction of this spiral, I began to see it as a base for a stem vase.

  As the overall piece arrived at a pleasing proportion, I realized that the mouth of the vase was too wide to hold flower stems upright. So I decided to create a lattice-work insert for the top. Then, while designing this insert, I imagined stem-coloured gemstones set as part of the pattern. As it turned out, the polished interior of the vase backlit these gems beautifully and amplified their luminosity.

  The process throughout was purely intuitive.
