  The design of this ring is an exercise in smooth continuation of line. A single piece of metal encircles the stone then swings down and around the finger.

  When worn, the sapphire appears as if floating above the hand. Light easily enters the stone from above and below.

  The stone itself is an exceptionally beautiful blue sapphire from Ceylon.
