  The commission for this Pagoda-shaped miniature chest of drawers came from a man who had spent his childhood years in China. His name was Arthur Brecken and he was my first teacher of silver work. In the use of round wire and twisted wire patterning, the Pagoda is a tribute to his style.
  The following pictures show just a few highlights in the overall process of building this piece. For example, in the photos the lower layer of drawers and the top roof with a peridot at its apex are already finished.
  The seven main components (the ebony base, the 3 layers of drawers, and the 3 roofs) all become mechanically secured to one another by way of blind rivets.
  The three layers of drawers are each colour-coded by a different type of stone set in their drawer handles — rubies in the bottom layer, sapphires in the middle, and emeralds in the upper.

    description: 'Here the Pagoda is temporarily set up. The bottom and top areas are finished. The drawers in the middle two layers still need to have their wire patterns created and their handles attached. The bottom two roofs are in their early stages of being framed in.'

    description: 'Here the drawers are fully constructed and their handles are set with gems. The bottom two roofs are at different stages of completion. Both now have their edge wires soldered in place which clearly articulate the flipped up corners of the roofs. The lower roof has its pattern of wires partly built in.'

    description: 'This detail photo of the bottom roof shows how the wires are set into the framework. The five shiny wires toward the lower left corner are not yet soldered. The ends of each wire are carved so that they lock into the framework and hold themselves in place to be soldered.'

    description: 'This view from above the finished roof shows how the composite effect of the wires constructed side by side resembles the pattern of a Pagoda tile roof.'

    description: 'A detail of the finished piece. The gemstone at the apex is a pagoda-cut peridot — literally, the girdle of the stone angles up at the corners and the prongs are attached at the lowest points along the edge.'
