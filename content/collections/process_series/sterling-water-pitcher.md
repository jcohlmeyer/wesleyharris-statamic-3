  I have always wanted to create a water pitcher where the very shape of the piece serves as its handle. The three-dimensional complexity of such a shape makes it almost impossible to smith, however, I could imagine gradually building it up out of heavy wire. This is how the sterling water pitcher was made.

  At first I tried to build a rib-cage-like framework into which other strands of wire would be fit and soldered, but it was nearly impossible to not over-heat or melt the free-standing wires. It proved much more successful to build a solid form as I went. In total there are 241 wires.

  I love the surface texture that results. It has the classic quality of a fluted column while also having an organic feel like blades of grass side by side — some tapered, some full width. I also love the overall shape — almost ladies-slipper-orchid-like.

    description: 'The beginning. A styrofoam model was made as a guide to the form. The first 2 wires are soldered to the base (the wires are 1/8" in diameter). A template is temporarily attached at the narrowest area of the neck.'

    description: 'This shows the extent to which a rib-cage-like framework was built before beginning to fill in a solid surface. Medium silver solder was used throughout.'

    description: 'The area of the handle was constructed first because it was the most complex shape and needed to be heated from both sides to avoid over-heating.'

    description: 'This photograph clearly shows how the process went once the surface was solid. I am holding a wire that has been precisely bent to the needed contour, tapered at both ends, and slightly grooved along the tapered areas. In that way, each wire literally locks itself in place to be soldered.'

    description: 'The handle area is fully constructed, and the surface has now reached one of the two original wires. Each soldering usually involves some cleaning up of excess solder on the surface.'

    description: 'Gradually working around the form, usually at a rate of two or three wires per day. The temporary template is still being used in the narrowest area of the neck.'

    description: 'This photo (and the previous photo) shows how a single wire is soldered at the bottom and near the top, then another wire will divide that gap and be soldered top and bottom, then two more sliver-like wires will be soldered in to fill the two remaining spaces.'

    description: 'Both sides of the pitcher are now constructed the same distance around. Two cardboard templates (barely visible in this photo) were used throughout the process to maintain symmetry.'

    description: 'The pitcher is shown ready to be soldered. The wire to be attached is tied with binding wire at the top with a temporary spacer in place. Flux can be seen dried in the area of the join. Under heat, the flux becomes glass-like which keeps the metal clean and helps the solder flow.'

    description: 'The finished pitcher. The surfaces have been polished and the grooves on the outer surface have been oxidized. A rutillated quartz, facetted by Edgar Hasselfeldt, is set in the curve above the handle area.'
