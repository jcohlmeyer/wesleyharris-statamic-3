  This is the first mokume gane piece that I made.

  In Japanese, mokume gane means "woodgrain metal."

  When creating a work with this technique, I want the implication of woodgrain to make sense. For example, this pin/pendant is meant to look like an owl in a hollow tree.  The mokume pattern that unfolded resembles weather wood, yet it also appears totem-pole-like and even looks like flames.

  The owl-face is a watercasting, created serendipitously by dropping molten metal in water. The face has a scull-like quality — are the moonstone "eyes" signs of wisdom, or are they haunting, or perhaps something sinister? The ambiguities are open to interpretation.

    description: 'Two rows of fifteen layers of different coloured metals, all perfectly flat and clean. A layer of 18 k. green gold is seen fourth from the right in each row. The other metals are sterling silver, copper, brass, and two copper alloys: shakudo, and shibuichi.'

    description: 'The entire assembly of stacks and bolted steel plates is embedded in charcoal inside a stainless steel foil bag. When sealed, the interior of this bag will maintain a reducing or non-oxidizing atmosphere.'

    description: 'The filled, sealed bag is placed in a digital kiln and heated at about 1400 degrees fahrenheit for 14 hours. The temperature is held just below the lowest eutectic alloy melting point that results between the layers. Literally, under heat and pressure, molecular growth between the layers fuses the stacks into solid blocks.'

    description: 'The stacks, smithed out like pancakes, are now heavy sheets. The edges have been coated with solder. All the contrasting layers of metal are still contained within the mokume.'

    description: 'Placed upon the two sheets is a 14 k. yellow gold watercasting (the random result of dropping molten metal in water). While being smithed, some of the internal mokume layers have become exposed at the surface (lower corners).'

    description: 'The two triangular mokume sheets are filed flush along their longest length and soldered together edge to edge. A single sterling sheet also backs the joined mokume shape (not obvious in the photo).'

    description: 'Revealing the pattern. The two areas of pattern near the corners were created by filing through the layers and hammering them smooth. In another area, the layers are carved into and exposed. The process of partially cutting back the top edge of the piece is also beginning and is intended to create the random-edged look of the top of a weathered hollow tree.'

    description: 'More carving into the mokume to reveal pattern. More random edge along the top is cut away while the higher points are actually bent up beyond the original edge. During this bending, the bond between the mokume layers remained 100% strong.'

    description: 'The finished piece. The surface is smoothed to a bright satin, and the mokume is patined using ammonia fumes. The gold and sterling colours remain unchanged, the copper becomes a rich chocolate brown, the shakudo (96% copper and 4% gold) turns a rich plum-black, and the shibuichi (85% copper and 15% silver) turns turquoise-gray, (the brass never became visible). The patined mokume is sealed with 20 coats of Johnson’s floor wax.'
