  This bracelet is in the form of a moebius strip — the inside surface rolls on edge and becomes the outside surface and visa versa.

  In this case, the "strip" of gold is 5 mm. thick which, in the final piece, allows a row of diamonds to be set directly into its edge.

  There is something almost mathematically pleasing about the moebius shape, perhaps due to its infinitely flowing surface. It also reminds me of some of M. C. Escher's optical illusion art.

  This bracelet is hinged and precisely opens and closes with a box-catch.

    description: 'The hinge is shown temporarily assembled while the box catch is being created. The spring for the catch (shown on my finger) will be soldered to the end at the right. Inside the left end, a space is precisely cut out to receive the spring. This stage is the most critical — the "locking" step in the spring must line up perfectly with its corresponding shape in the cut out area.'

    description: 'The spring has been soldered precisely in place and its step "locks" perfectly within the cut out area. There is also room for the spring to be pressed to release the catch. With a temporary wedge-shaped support placed within the spring, its very end is lightly hammered to harden it enough to give it spring tension. Once it is certain that the spring functions properly, walls are fit into both sides of the cut out area to complete the box catch.'
