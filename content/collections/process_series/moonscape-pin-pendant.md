  The outside surface of the half geode resembles a cratered moonscape. This was my cue to create a circular piece in two halves with a cratered texture overall.

  The sterling silver half can be seen as a "sky" with topaz "stars," or both halves together can be thought of as a cratered moonscape viewed from above.

  The geode and the sterling halves are pre-fit into the circular framework from behind, and the securing of both is done on the back.

  The setting is indirect. A conforming collar accurately holds both halves in place, and the bevelled outer edge of this collar is bezel set by the circular framework.
