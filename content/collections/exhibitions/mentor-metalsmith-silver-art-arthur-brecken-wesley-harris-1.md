  _Mentor & Metalsmith_ was an exhibition in tribute to my high school art teacher, Arthur Brecken, the man who started me in silver work in 1972. The display included 23 of his finest silver pieces and 50 of mine that spanned my career and illlustrated how my style evolved out of his. 

  This photo was taken at the time of the grand opening in March 2018 at the Craft Council of Newfoundland and Labrador main gallery in St. John's. In the foreground can be seen one of several direct pairings of my work with that of my teacher's, namely my full scale Tea Service and Arthur's miniature Doll's Tea Set. A little farther back to the left is a pairing of our sculptural pieces inspired by nature â€” my Labrador Wave and Arthur's Cattails. In addition to pairings and groupings of our work, the exhibition was also organized around several themes. In this photo, for example, can be seen signage for the themes of Nature & Gardens and Humour. Another theme was The Chinese Influence, and to the right in the photo is a pedestal containing works illustrating the themes of Faith, and Music.  

  St. John's, Newfoundland, was the first stop for Mentor & Metalsmith on a cross-Canada tour of 5 galleries that unfolded over 12 months. Showings in Vancouver, Ontario, Halifax, and Corner Brook followed, and I travelled with the exhibit and met the public at each venue. A fully-illustrated 172 page catalogue was also published. Extra copies remain available for $49 CAD (including shipping). Payment is requested prior to delivery.

    description: 'In the early autumn of 2018, Mentor & Metalsmith travelled to the Wellington County Museum & Archives in southern Ontario. It was like bringing the exhibit home to the area in which I grew up and where my teacher had lived and worked for the last 47 years of his life. One of the special visitors to this gallery was Canadian silversmith, Lois Etherington Betteridge (above). In 1975, Lois had taught and encouraged me during a five day metalsmithing workshop.'
