  This juried exhibition took place in 2005.  Fifty items of jewellery and hollowware were accepted, and I was honoured to have my piece featured on the front cover of the catalogue.  Within the catalogue, the text under my entry reads:

  "The play of light in nature pleases me. In my 'Northern Lights Pendant' a quintessentially Canadian pine tree is silhouetted against the night sky. Three diamond 'stars' shine brightly. From some angles the labradorite 'sky' looks dark, while at other angles wonderful curtains of green light shimmer across it like the aurora borealis."
