  "Rare Reflections - The Art of Wesley Harris" was a solo show that took place between March 19th and April 24th, 2011. It featured a total of 27 of my pieces - 13 hollowware and 14 jewellery.  

  The exhibition title can be interpreted on several levels. A show of hollowware itself is rare. Some of the metals and gemstones included are rare, and those materials are also reflective. Certain pieces in the show were literally reflections of nature. And, overall, the body of work reflected my career to that point. The pieces ranged in style from ornate to organic, from geometric to gently relaxed, and from symmetrical to subtly asymmetrical.
