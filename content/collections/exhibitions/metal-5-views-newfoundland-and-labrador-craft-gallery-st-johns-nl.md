  Metal: 5 Views was shown at the main gallery of the Craft Council of Newfoundland and Labrador in the Fall of 2002. It featured the work of five established metalsmiths living and working in this province.

  The show was curated by Gloria Hickey in response to the fact that the province's metalsmithing community, which is small, had rarely been featured in an exhibit. The five artists chosen included two silversmiths, a blacksmith, a pewtersmith, and a bronze sculptor.

  The overall exhibit was very sculptural in feel. The tallest piece by Luben Boykov reached the ceiling, and even my three rings (the only jewellery in the show) pushed the limits of scale. The steel sculptures of Jim Maunder were conceptually based, Ray Cox's pewter bowls and patinas were experimental, and the silver hollowware of Mike Massie reflected his native heritage.

  Taken together, Metal: 5 views was a strong show where the worlds of fine art and fine craft comfortably slipped back and forth.
