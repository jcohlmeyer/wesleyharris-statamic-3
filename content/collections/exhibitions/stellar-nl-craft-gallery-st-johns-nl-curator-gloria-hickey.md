main_text: '"Stellar" was an exhibition curated by Gloria Hickey. Gloria invited 8 established Newfoundland artists to take part, and it was her concept to feature the finest works that she could find. In addition to myself, the artists included were John Goodyear (wood), Nicola Hawkins (mixed media), Stan Hill (antler carving),  Jason Holley (ceramic and silver), Catherine McCausland (felting), Terry Nichols (glass), and Anita Singh (ceramics). The show took place at the Newfoundland and Labrador Craft Council main gallery between October 10th and November 14th, 2015.'
